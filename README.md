TEACHING EXPERIMENT OF CHEMOMETRICS FOR MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION IN DETERMINATION OF PARACETAMOL IN COMMERCIAL TABLETS USING NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY: 
A TUTORIAL, PART II. 

The aim of this manuscript was to show the basic concepts and practical application of Partial Least Squares (PLS) as a tutorial, 
using the Matlab computing environment for beginners, undergraduate and graduate students. 
As a practical example, the determination of the drug paracetamol in commercial tablets using Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy 
and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was shown, an experiment that has been successfully carried out at the Chemical Institute of Campinas State University 
for chemistry undergraduate course students to introduce the basic concepts of multivariate calibration in a practical way.
